## Abstract

We study how advance information about future labour income affects current household
consumption. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that working
households adjust their current consumption in anticipation of future persistent income changes.
Their positive consumption response indirectly confirms householdsâ€™ undocumented access to
advance information. We construct a consumption-saving model and use it to map observed
consumption response patterns into the unobserved probability of receiving future information
ahead of time. Our estimation results suggest this probability has a baseline value and increases
with current persistent income. Moreover, the consumption response to advance information
is asymmetric and depends on the type of income change expected. We find that households
with access to advance information are better self-insured against persistent income shocks than
those without such information. Their consumption responses to persistent shocks are dynamic,
with about 70% of the total adjustment occurring in the period when the information is first
received. Finally, we show that the conventional covariance-based estimators of consumption
insurance exhibit sizeable biases when advance information is ignored.
