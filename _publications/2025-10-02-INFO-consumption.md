## Abstract

This paper studies how advance information about future labour income affects current
household consumption. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that
working households adjust their current consumption in anticipation of future persistent income
changes, indicating households’ undocumented access to advance information. I construct a
partial equilibrium, consumption-saving model to map observed consumption response patterns
into the unobserved probability of receiving advance information by households with different
level of persistent income. My findings suggest that first, households with access to advance
information are better self-insured against persistent income shocks compared to those without
such information. Second, informed households’ consumption responses to persistent shocks
are dynamic, with around 70% of the total adjustment occurring in the period when the in-
formation is first received. Lastly, I show that accounting for short-term foresight significantly
alter our established understanding of consumption insurance and the welfare consequence of
existing government-funded income assistance programs. The combination of nonlinear panel
method and structural modelling can uncover hidden behavioural mechanisms that are otherwise
unobservable.
