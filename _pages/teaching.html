I am a sessional instructor for the China Program in the Department of Economics at Dalhousie University. From 2020 to 2025, I also served as a teaching assistant in the Department of Economics at Queenâ€™s University.

I instructed Intermediate Macroeconomics during the Spring/Summer terms of 2023, 2024, and 2025 for second-year economics students at Shandong University of Finance and Economics. The course syllabus and materials will be made available here soon.

A comprehensive list of undergraduate and graduate economics courses for which I served as a teaching assistant is available in my CV.
