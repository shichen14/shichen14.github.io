Hello and welcome to my professonal home page!

I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.queensu.ca/) at Queen's University. My research focus on using micro-level data to study the interactions between labour income and household consumptions.

I am on the 2025-2026 job market and will be available for interviews.
